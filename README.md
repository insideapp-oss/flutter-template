# flutter_template_insideapp

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that fetches cryptocurrency data using the CoinCap API. Designed with best practices in mind, it follows Clean Architecture and incorporates BLoC for state management, along with a structured approach for use cases, repositories, and services. Dependency injection is managed using GetIt (Service locator).

# Features
- Fetch Real-Time Cryptocurrency Data: Leverages the CoinCap API (https://docs.coincap.io/) for real-time data.
- Clean Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns, making the code more robust, scalable, and maintainable.
- BLoC Pattern: Utilizes the Business Logic Component (BLoC) pattern for state management.
- Use Cases and Repositories: Organizes business logic and data layer effectively.
- GetIt for Dependency Injection: Manages dependencies efficiently and cleanly.
